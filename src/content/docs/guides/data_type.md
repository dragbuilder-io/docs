# Data Types in DragBuilder

In DragBuilder, **Data Types** allow you to define custom structures that represent complex data models within your application. By creating data types, you can manage and manipulate grouped sets of related properties, making your app more organized and scalable.

---

## What are Data Types?

- **Data Types** are custom-defined collections of properties that represent a specific entity or model in your app.
- They enable you to handle complex data structures as single units.
- Data types can be used to bind data to UI components, pass data between screens, and interact with external APIs.

---

## Example: Creating an `ArticleItem` Data Type

Imagine you are building a news app and need to represent articles with specific attributes.

### Properties of `ArticleItem`:

- **title**: The headline of the article.
- **description**: A brief summary of the article content.
- **headerImageUrl**: A URL to the article's header image.
- **createdDate**: The publication date of the article.

By defining an `ArticleItem` data type, you can easily manage and display articles throughout your app.

## Using Data Types in Your App

### Binding Data Types to UI Components

- Refer to the [dynamic number of items](/advanced_ui/dynamic_items)

### Populating Data

- **Static Data**:
    - Manually create instances of the data type with predefined values for testing.
- **Dynamic Data**:
    - Fetch data from external APIs or databases and map the results to your data type.
    - Use actions like **"Call External API"** to retrieve data.
